The point is, in my opinion fua is not the worst case we need to test.
Only flush could leads us to the worst case we really need to test.

In btrfs' case, if we finished flush, but without fua, we have a super
block points to all old trees, but all new trees are already written to
disk.

In that flush entry, we could reach to the worst case scenario to verify
all btrfs tricks are working all together to get a completely sane btrfs
(even all data should be correct).

This should also apply to journal based filesystems (if I understand the
journal thing correctly), even when all journals written but superblock
not updated, we should be completely fine.
(Although for journal, we may need to reach fua entry instead of flush?)

And the other reason why we need to find next flush/fua manually is,
mount will write new data, and we need to replay all the sequence until
next flush/fua.


And finally the reason about why need manually mount is, we need to
workaround e2fsck/xfs_repair, so that they won't report dirty journal as
error. If we have extra options to disable such behavior, I'm completely
OK with current --check flush/fua --fsck method.
(BTW, for my btrfs testing, --check flush --fsck is completely good
enough, to exposed possible free space cache related problems)
