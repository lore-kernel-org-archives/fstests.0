We need likely to open  RFE bugzilla  here - and specify how it should
work when some conditions are met.

Current 'best effort' tries to minimize damage by trying to do a full-stop
when pool approaches 95% fullness.  Which is relatively 'low/small' for small 
sized thin-pool - but there is reasonable big free space for
commonly sized thin-pool to be able to flush most of page cache on
disk before things will go crazy.

Now - we could probably detect presence of kernel version and xfs/ext4 present 
features - and change reactions.

What I expect from this BZ is -  how to detect things and what is the 'best' 
thing to do.

I'm clearly not an expert on all filesystem and all their features - but lvm2
needs to work reasonable well across all variants of kernels and filesystems - 
  so we cannot say to user - now  we require you to use the latest 4.10
kernel with these features enabled otherwise all your data could be lost.

We need to know what to do with 3.X  kernel,  4.X kernel and present features 
in kernel and how we can detect them in runtime.

Zdenek
