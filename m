I have a sleep 1 before the unmount.  To be honest this lvm behavior
of auto-unmounting on error seems like a huge mess, I wonder if there is
a way to disable it?

Even on a production system I'd much rather have a shutdown XFS fs
than LVM trying to unmount, probably hanging because there are busy
fds on the fs, and if not the application might not write to another
fs becaus of this.  It's just an amazingly stupid idea.
