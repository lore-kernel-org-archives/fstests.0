Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Initial CephFS tests (take 2)
Date:   Wed,  7 Oct 2020 18:52:09 +0100

This is my second attempt to have an initial set of ceph-specific tests
merged into fstests.  In this patchset I'm pushing a different set of
tests, focusing on the copy_file_range testing, although I *do* plan to
get back to the quota tests soon.

This syscall has a few peculiarities in ceph as it is able to use remote
object copies without the need to download/upload data from the OSDs.
However, in order to take advantage of this remote copy, the copy ranges
and sizes need to include at least one object.  Thus, all the currently
existing generic tests won't actually take advantage of this feature.

Let me know any comments/concerns about this patchset.  Also note that
currently, in order to enable copy_file_range in cephfs, the additional
'copyfrom' mount parameter is required.  (Hopefully this additional param
may be dropped in the future.)

Luis Henriques (3):
  ceph: add copy_file_range (remote copy operation) testing
  ceph: test combination of copy_file_range with truncate
  ceph: test copy_file_range with infile = outfile
