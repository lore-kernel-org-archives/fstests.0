Agreed.

Yes, old kernels have bugs.  Enterprise distros should fix those bugs,
configure && make distros and roll-your-own users get what they
get, IMHO.

unmounting is a bad idea.  It's not even guaranteed to complete,
because unmount may well require IO.  It has undesirable and unpredictable
impacts on the system.  At a bare minimum, it should not be the default
behavior.

It's great that lvm2 stays compatible - xfsprogs does too,
FWIW - but trying to work around every old bad behavior is likely
to be a fool's errand, IMHO.

But unmounting /does not/ solve that for them.  It's bad behavior.
It's far better IMHO to let xfs spew errors to the log for a day
than to unmount a volume and then fill the root fs with ongoing
IO, for example.

Ok, back to concrete things: Right, XFS behavior is tunable, but
largely unchanged other than a better behavior at unmount.  Default
behavior in the face of IO errors is otherwise unchanged.  Not all
the world is thinp; there are other error conditions and cases which
may warrant different responses.  As such, the default remains to
keep trying IO unless something critical fails, which will then shut
down the filesystem.

That said, lvm2 offering to configure such behavior for xfs on a thin
volume might be quite reasonable.

I really think we need a robust test framework for all of this so we
can move beyond anecdotes and assumptions, and get some repeatable
regression tests going.
