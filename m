More problems after this failure, while trying to sort out a
workaround I can use. Reboot the machine after triggering it, and on
next boot I've ended up with:

$ sudo lvs
  LV       VG     Attr       LSize   Pool Origin   Data%  Meta%  Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert
  base_081 vg_081 owi---s--- 256.00m

$ sudo pvremove -f /dev/pmem1
  PV /dev/pmem1 belongs to Volume Group vg_081 so please use vgreduce first.
  (If you are certain you need pvremove, then confirm by using --force twice.)
$

So whatever is going wrong is also resulting in corrupted LVM
headers on disk.

Ok, so it appears that the only workaround I've found that is
reliable is to add a "sleep 5" between the unmount and the vgremove
command. Adding udev settle commands does nothing, and there's
nothing else i can think of that would affect the unmounted
filesystem or block device once the unmount has returned to
userspace.

I've only ever seen this occur on pmem devices, so maybe it's
something perculiar to them....

Cheers,

Dave.
