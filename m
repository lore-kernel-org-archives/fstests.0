No we need to fix upstream.  It is the job of distros to sort out other
solutions.  And yeah I appreciate that you need to worry about distro X,
Y, Z from Red Hat but lvm2 needs to not be so cute about things.

And there has been significant progress on XFS's error handling so that
it no longer hangs in the face of ENOSPC.

Eric says the basics are documented in Documentation/filesystems/xfs.txt
under "Error Handling".

Bottomline is lvm2 really has no business unmounting the filesystem.
That lvm2 "feature" should be reverted.  It isn't what anyone would
expect.  And it only serves to create problems.  Nice intent but it was
a misfire to implement it.  At most a discard should be issued once you
cross a threshold.
