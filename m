I have no knowledge about cephfs, I don't have a cephfs test env either,
so I can only comment from fstests' perspect of view. It'd be great if
other ceph folks could help review this patchset as well.

From fstests perspect of view, this patchset looks fine to me, just some
minor comments go to individual patch.

I assume '_require_xfs_io_command "copy_range"' will _notrun the test if
there's no 'copyfrom' mount option provided, and test won't fail.

New test should have file mode 755, i.e. with x bit set. The 'new'
script should have done this for you.

Thanks,
